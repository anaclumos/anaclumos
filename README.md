I am a senior in CS (B.S.) at [USC](https://usc.edu). I am very interested in fandom cultures, computer graphics, and product service designs. My far-reach interests are medical technologies, nuclear fusion energies, and deep space terraformings. I am also exploring blockchains... my wallet address is [`0xCC...Ccd6`](https://rainbow.me/0xCC441Db84Bf28ea2740e2778c662FA4B515ACcd6).
